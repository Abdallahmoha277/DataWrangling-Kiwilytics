# Kiwilytics Data Wrangling Project

In this project, I focused on data wrangling and preprocessing for the **Kiwilytics** dataset using Python (Google Colab).  
My goal was to clean the raw data, engineer new features, and prepare the dataset for analysis and reporting.

## üìä Key Takeaways

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- I learned how to inspect raw data, identify data quality issues, and understand column types, missing values, and distributions.

### Data Cleaning Techniques I Practiced
- Handling invalid or missing dates  
- Fixing non-numeric and negative values in cost fields  
- Managing nulls in critical columns like `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, and `ShipCity`  
- Correcting inconsistent formatting and standardization  
- Applying feature engineering  

### New Features I Created
- **DeliveryDays**: the number of days between order and shipment  
- **DeliveryStatus**: a flag for late vs on-time shipments  
- **IsDomestic**: to distinguish local vs international orders  
- **Exported Cleaned Data** for further use

## üöÄ Final Output
I prepared a **final, cleaned dataset** ready for:
- Analytics  
- Reporting  
- Loading into a database

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools I Used
- Python  
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Google Colab

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Clone this repository or open the notebook directly in Colab.  
2. Run all cells to reproduce my results.
